# NAME

rspamc - rspamd command line client

# SYNOPSIS

rspamc [*options*] [*command*] [*input-file*]...

rspamc --help

# DESCRIPTION

Rspamc is a simple client for checking messages using rspamd or for learning rspamd by messages.
Rspamc supports the following commands:

* Scan commands:
	* *symbols*: scan message and show symbols (default command)
* Control commands
	* *learn_spam*: learn message as spam
	* *learn_ham*: learn message as ham
	* *fuzzy_add*: add message to fuzzy storage (check `-f` and `-w` options for this command)
	* *fuzzy_del*: delete message from fuzzy storage (check `-f` option for this command)
	* *stat*: show rspamd statistics
	* *stat_reset*: show and reset rspamd statistics (useful for graphs)
	* *counters*: display rspamd symbols statistics
	* *uptime*: show rspamd uptime
	* *add_symbol*: add or modify symbol settings in rspamd
	* *add_action*: add or modify action settings

Control commands that modifies rspamd state are considered as privileged and basically requires a password
to be specified with `-P` option (see **OPTIONS**, below, for details). 
This depends on a controller's settings and is discussed in `rspamd-workers` page.

`Input files` may be either regular file(s) or a directory to scan. If no files are specified rspamc reads
from the standard input. Controller commands usually does not accept any input, however learn* and fuzzy* commands
requires input.

# EXAMPLES

Check stdin:

	rspamc < some_file

Check files:
	
	rspamc symbols file1 file2 file3
	
Learn files:

	rspamc -P pass learn_spam file1 file2 file3

Add fuzzy hash to set 2:
	
	rspamc -P pass -f 2 -w 10 fuzzy_add file1 file2
	
Delete fuzzy hash from other server:

	rspamc -P pass -h hostname:11334 -f 2 fuzzy_del file1 file2
	
Get statistics:
	
	rspamc stat

Get uptime:
	
	rspamc uptime

Add custom rule's weight:
